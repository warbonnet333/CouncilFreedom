        <p>On the 24th of February, 2022 russia has started a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The rocket strikes all
          over Ukrainian territories were accompanied with terrestrial onset.</p>
        <p>Being unable to succeed with a blitzkrieg, quick occupation of Kyiv and other big Ukrainian cities, the
          russian army has taken on the most inhuman tactics – annihilation of Ukrainian cities avoiding a direct
          contact with military services: through the rocket attacks, air raids and heavy aerial support.</p>
        <p>According to the UNO, since the beginning of the war more than 3,5 mln of people have left the territory of
          Ukraine. According to the UNO’s migration agency, about 6,5 mln of Ukrainians have become internally
          displaced. </p>
        <p>The office of the Ukrainian Prosecutor General has published a statistic of criminal offences committed by
          russia during its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The most painful is the presence of children among the civil
          victims (139 dead and at least 205 injured). </p>
        <p>The entire world got together to stop the bloody dictator. See, what could be your personal help.</p>

            Many logistic chains are completely disrupted now, a great deal of enterprises was physically destroyed,
            some are unable to operate in war environments, and a lot of workers have left. People, who lived on
            territories with warfare running, remained dishoused and destitute. They are being given shelter but the
            resources are scarce. We do our best to prevent a humanitarian crisis. Please, join with us for the rescue
